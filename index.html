                I grew up in Owasso, Oklahoma and in 8th grade moved to Waco, Texas. I then went on to graduate form Baylor University with a Studio Art degree concentration in photography. It was a very rewarding experience that allowed me to grow not only as an artist, but in my knowledge of art as well.

                My interest include hockey, soccer, hunting, fishing and obviously art. I have tried in my life to find something that allows me to feed that creative need which has driven a lot of my career decisions. My zeal for hunting and fishing comes from my deep desire to experiencce nature and be one with the planet. When working on art in college, the majority of my time was spent rock climbing outdoors with freinds and camping.
